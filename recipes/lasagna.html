    <p>Start by preparing the meat sauce. In a large pan, heat olive oil and sauté chopped onions and garlic until translucent. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spatula. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil. Let the sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes to develop flavor, stirring occasionally.</p>
    <p>While the sauce simmers, prepare the cheese mixture. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, chopped parsley, and a generous handful of grated mozzarella and Parmesan. Mix until smooth and set aside. If you're using no-boil lasagna noodles, you can skip pre-cooking. Otherwise, boil the noodles according to package instructions and lay them flat on a towel to cool.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, then more meat sauce. Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with sauce and shredded mozzarella.</p>
    <p>Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling. Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
