    <p>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve some pasta water before draining. In a large pan, heat olive oil and add thinly sliced garlic. Sauté gently until golden but not burnt.</p>
    <p>Add red chili flakes and stir briefly. Toss in the cooked spaghetti and mix well, adding reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce. Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.</p>
    <p>Finish with chopped parsley and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Serve immediately, optionally topped with grated Parmesan or lemon zest for added brightness.</p>
